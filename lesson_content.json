    "narrator_script": "Hey mathletes!  Calculus \u2013 it sounds intimidating, right? But it's actually all around us!  Forget dusty textbooks; calculus is the secret sauce behind everything from designing roller coasters to predicting the spread of diseases.  Today, we're diving into some cool applications. We'll see how derivatives help us find the maximum profit, and integrals let us calculate areas and volumes.  Think of it like this: derivatives tell us about *instantaneous* change \u2013 like the speed of your car at any given moment. Integrals deal with *accumulation* \u2013 like the total distance you've traveled.  We'll explore real-world scenarios to show you exactly how powerful this math is!  Get ready to be amazed!",
    "lyrics": "Calculus, oh calculus, so much to explore,\nDerivatives for slopes, and integrals for more.\nFinding max and min, areas underneath,\nSolving real-world problems, from head to feet!\nVelocity and acceleration, change over time,\nCalculus, oh calculus, truly sublime!\nOptimization problems, that make our day,\nCalculus is here to show us the way!",
